What happens when you initialize a
repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git places a .git file for commit
storage in the directory. It turns
the directory into a repository
in which you can run git commands.
This way, you can utilize the cool
features git offers, such as commits,
git log, git clone, etc. It turns the
directory into something much more
effective when editing code.
