What happens when you initialize a
repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git places a .git file for commit
storage in the directory. It turns
the directory into a repository
in which you can run git commands.
This way, you can utilize the cool
features git offers, such as commits,
git log, git clone, etc. It turns the
directory into something much more
effective when editing code.

How is the staging area different from
the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

I think the staging area is where you
put the files that you want to link
to git before you commit them. It's
inside the working directory, which
should have every file in the repository
whether you choose to commit them or not.
