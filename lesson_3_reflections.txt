When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to do this if I'm not on my main
computer or if someone else is working on a
project with me.

Why might you want to always pull changes
manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I'm not sure why I would pick pulling rather
than pushing. I guess I would rather push,
because I don't want my work to be public until
I'm ready. I would also be able to work offline
and have more flexibility. I could see why pull
instead would probably be a better option.
There's less of a chance of forgetting about
where your work is, but for now, pushing seems
best for me. I only use one computer at the
moment.
