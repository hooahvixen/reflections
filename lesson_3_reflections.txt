When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to do this if I'm not on my main
computer or if someone else is working on a
project with me.

Why might you want to always pull changes
manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I'm not sure why I would pick pulling rather
than pushing. I guess I would rather push,
because I don't want my work to be public until
I'm ready. I would also be able to work off-line
and have more flexibility. I could see why pull
instead would probably be a better option.
There's less of a chance of forgetting about
where your work is, but for now, pushing seems
best for me. I only use one computer at the
moment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones,
and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?

Well, a fork takes a copy of the repository from
one user and allows another user to make changes
to their version without changing the original
repository. A clone copies a repository, that you
specifically have permission to work on, onto your
local hard drive so that you can make changes to
the copy you cloned. And branches diverge from the
master branch (or whatever) so that you can do
things in the repository that you're not sure you
want to add to the main branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last
known state of the remote stored locally?

This way, when someone updates it on GitHub, it
won't give you a whole bunch of conflicts. You
won't have to merge anything until you're ready
to do it and you have control over how it happens.
You've got the power!
